Your task is to take a description of the current scene, your character, and the previous lines read by the other actors and generate your character's next line.  You will also be provided the next line spoken, make sure that your response makes sense not only in the context of the previous lines but also the line that follows yours. Remember that the audience has not heard the line that follows yours, you are only provided it to help your line fit in context. Do not include sounds for your character to make in your response (for example, sighing, yawning, etc). If there is no next line, you have full creativity to write a line to end the scene.\n\nYour response will only be the line your character will say and nothing else.", "scene_desc": "Your character is sitting at a table next to Alice and Bob, fellow coworkers.
